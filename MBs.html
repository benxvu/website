    <h1>MotherBoards</h1>
    <h2><b>General Knowledge</b></h2>
   
    <p>
      A motherboard is a printed circuit board containing the principal components of a computer or other device, with connectors into 
      which other circuit boards can be slotted. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components 
      of a system, such as the central processing unit and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. The motherboard is 
      the backbone that ties the computer's components together at one spot and allows them to talk to each other. Without it, none of 
      the computer pieces, such as the CPU, GPU, or hard drive, could interact. Total motherboard functionality is necessary for a 
      computer to work well. The motherboard in other sense is the body and soul of the pc. It is single handedly the most important 
      componenet of a computer so whatever you do, definetly do not be settling for a cheaper motherboard for better parts.
    
    <H2><b>Purchasing A Motherboard</b></h2>
      
      <p>
        When purchasing a motherboard you need to do a lot of research. You have to figure out whether the motherboard you are buying is
        compatible with your GPU and CPU. Once you find a motherboard that's compatible with your other components you need to know the
        size of your motherboard whether it's a full atx or not. You need to know the size of your motherboard to know what case you
        will buy, because some motherboards are too big for certain cases. After all that there are little options you can find like whether
        the motherboard has Wifi and/or Bluetooth built in or not.
