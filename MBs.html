      A motherboard is a printed circuit board containing the principal components of a computer or other device, with connectors into which other circuit boards can be 
      slotted. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit and memory, 
      and provides connectors for other peripherals. The motherboard is the backbone that ties the computer's components together at one spot and allows them to 
      talk to each other. Without it, none of the computer pieces, such as the CPU, GPU, or hard drive, could interact. Total motherboard functionality is necessary for
      a computer to work well. The motherboard in other sense is the body and soul of the pc. It is single handedly the most important componenet of a computer 
      so whatever you do, definetly do not be settling for a cheaper motherboard for better parts.
