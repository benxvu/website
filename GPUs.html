    <h2><b>General Knowledge</b></h2>
    <p>
      The GPU (<b><i>Graphics Processing Unit</i></b>) is a chip or electronic circuit capable of rendering graphics for
      display on an electronic device. The GPU was originally designed to <b>accelerate graphics rendering</b>. The two top
      manufactorers for GPUs include Nvidia and AMD.

      <h2><b>Purchasing A GPU</b></h2>
      <p>
        When choosing to purchase a GPU you must compare and contrast two things, price and performance. The easiest way to compare
        and contrast which GPU might more worth it for it's price click <a href="https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/" alt="GPU Benchmark"> Here</a>.
        Here are some GPUs for certain builds that you might consider:
        
      <h3>RX 5700xt</h3>
      <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/amd-radeon-rx-5700-xt" alt="Link to 5700xt grpahics card">
      <img src="rx5700xt.jpg" alt="RX 5700XT">
      </a>
      <p>
        You can find a RX 5700XT for as low as <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/185679767100?chn=ps&mkevt=1&mkcid=28&srsltid=AeTuncpXgrtAiy-NMO0VrZtscquo8NkGdWRUGcyt9EAQaPeT3Rwd3Lmk5BQ">275$</a>
        The price to performance ratio on this graphics card is one of the best ratios out there in my opinion. 
        (<i>A little Bias considering that I use this card in my build</i>)
        
      <h3>RTX 4090</h3>
        <a href="https://store.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/store/?page=1&limit=9&locale=en-us&gpu=RTX%204090&category=GPU,DESKTOP" alt="link to nvidia 4090">

      </a>
      <p>
        The RTX 4090 (An Nvidia Card) is the best graphics card in the market right now. If you want an overkill build with high prestine
        the RTX 4090 is the GPU for you. The RTX 4090 is the best card in the market with a <Font Color= Green>+145%</Font> effective speed
        a <Font Color= Green>+167%</Font> General Performance. These are insanley incredible numbers however it is unecessary to have a GPU
        of that caliber.
