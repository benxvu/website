    <h2><b>General Knowledge</b></h2>
    <p>
      The GPU (<b><i>Graphics Processing Unit</i></b>) is a chip or electronic circuit capable of rendering graphics for
      display on an electronic device. The GPU was originally designed to <b>accelerate graphics rendering</b>. The two top
      manufactorers for GPUs include Nvidia and AMD.

      <h2><b>Purchasing A GPU</b></h2>
      <p>
        When choosing to purchase a GPU you must compare and contrast two things, price and performance. The easiest way to compare
        and contrast which GPU might more worth it for it's price click <a href="https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/" alt="GPU Benchmark"> Here</a>.
        Here are some GPUs for certain builds that you might consider:
        
      <h3>RX 5700xt</h3>
      <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/amd-radeon-rx-5700-xt" alt="Link to 5700xt grpahics card">
      <img src="rx5700xt.jpg" alt="RX 5700XT">
      </a>
      <p>
        You can find a RX 5700XT for as low as <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/185679767100?chn=ps&mkevt=1&mkcid=28&srsltid=AeTuncpXgrtAiy-NMO0VrZtscquo8NkGdWRUGcyt9EAQaPeT3Rwd3Lmk5BQ">275$</a>
        The price to performance ratio on this graphics card is one of the best ratios out there in my opinion. 
        (<i>A little Bias considering that I use this card in my build</i>)
